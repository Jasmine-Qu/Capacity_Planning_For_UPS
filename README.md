# Market-driven Capacity Planning For UPS


## 1. Project Overview
In this study, we investigate the value proposition of network flexibility in the context of international shipping and logistics operations. Together with our industry partner, UPS Asia Pacific (UPS), we investigate and quantify the value derived from the presence of network flexibility (i.e. the option to trans-ship goods via land transport to an alternative lane[ A ‘lane’ is an arc between one supply node and one demand node. In the context of this study, it refers to an arc formed by one origin airport (i.e. the supply node) to one destination airport (i.e. the demand node).]) in the supply chain. In the scope of this study, we consider the following two lanes – Shenzhen (SZX) to US and Hong Kong (HKG) to US. SZX and HKG represent the supply nodes whereas US represents the demand node, and we investigate the value of a unidirectional network flexibility between SZX and HKG under deterministic and non-deterministic demand conditions.

For this study, we were provided with forecast and actual historical demand data[ To preserve business confidentiality, the data used in this study has been masked. Unless otherwise stated, the data described in our study refers to masked data.] and the overage and underage costs on the 2 lanes by the UPS data analytics team. Based on these inputs, we developed various linear programming models corresponding to the different combinations of the scenarios (flexibility/no-flexibility with non-deterministic demand in the network) to perform the analysis.

Through this study, we observed that network flexibility could reduce overage and underage cost by 10.5% (in 2019) and 5.9% (in 2020) for a flexible network vis-à-vis a non-flexible one (using continuous demand distribution model) and suggest future direction to UPS in terms of capacity planning for the given two lanes.

## 3. Recommendations
1. **Flexible lane results in cost savings**. Introduction of a flexible lane network reduced the total overage and underage cost under a non-deterministic demand scenario. We observed a substantial cost reduction when there was network flexibility vis-à-vis a scenario without network flexibility. Hence, we recommend UPS to retain the flexibility in their network if they transition to capacity planning using non-deterministic demand

2. **Capacity planning using non-deterministic demand.** We recommend for UPS to consider adopting a non-deterministic approach for capacity planning purposes, since that could potentially help UPS to lower overage and underage costs. Considering the limited data used in this study, UPS may wish to perform an evaluation based on more forecast and historical demand data to confirm the impact of adopting a non-deterministic approach before implementation. UPS may wish to consider if the additional effort (if any) involved in switching to a non-deterministic approach would make it an endeavour worth pursuing. For our study, we modelled the continuous distribution of demand by leveraging the forecast data; UPS can consider similar approach for evaluating the benefits of network flexibility using more historical data, which would facilitate more accurate demand modelling. In case the demand modelling using the above approach is not feasible, UPS can consider approaches such as discrete modelling or Distributionally Robust Convex Optimization modelling.

3. **Demand modelling impacts the cost error estimation.** In our study, the total cost error, for most of the cases, is lower for the continuous normal distributions – hence, UPS can use this distribution to model the demand instead of discrete approach
