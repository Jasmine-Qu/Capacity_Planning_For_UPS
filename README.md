# Market-driven Capacity Planning For UPS


## 1. Project Overview
In this study, we investigate the value proposition of network flexibility in the context of international shipping and logistics operations. Together with our industry partner, UPS Asia Pacific (UPS), we investigate and quantify the value derived from the presence of network flexibility (i.e. the option to trans-ship goods via land transport to an alternative lane[ A ‘lane’ is an arc between one supply node and one demand node. In the context of this study, it refers to an arc formed by one origin airport (i.e. the supply node) to one destination airport (i.e. the demand node).]) in the supply chain. In the scope of this study, we consider the following two lanes – Shenzhen (SZX) to US and Hong Kong (HKG) to US. SZX and HKG represent the supply nodes whereas US represents the demand node, and we investigate the value of a unidirectional network flexibility between SZX and HKG under deterministic and non-deterministic demand conditions.

For this study, we were provided with forecast and actual historical demand data[ To preserve business confidentiality, the data used in this study has been masked. Unless otherwise stated, the data described in our study refers to masked data.] and the overage and underage costs on the 2 lanes by the UPS data analytics team. Based on these inputs, we developed various linear programming models corresponding to the different combinations of the scenarios (flexibility/no-flexibility with non-deterministic demand in the network) to perform the analysis.

Through this study, we observed that network flexibility could reduce overage and underage cost by 10.5% (in 2019) and 5.9% (in 2020) for a flexible network vis-à-vis a non-flexible one (using continuous demand distribution model) and suggest future direction to UPS in terms of capacity planning for the given two lanes.
